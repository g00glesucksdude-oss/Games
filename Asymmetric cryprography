This is how the Asymmetric Cryptography system (Private Key for signing, Public Key for verifying) would be used in practice for your key system.
​We will use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), as it provides high security with shorter key lengths, which is better for a lightweight Lua environment.
​1. Key Generation (Your Python Script) 🐍
​This step is done securely on your machine. You will need a Python library like cryptography for this.
​A. The Secret Assets
​Private Key: A large, random secret number stored in a file (e.g., private_key.pem).
​Public Key: Derived from the Private Key. This is the key you will embed in the Lua script.
​B. The Signing Process
​When a user provides their unique Account ID (A-ID), your script signs the key:

Define Payload Data:
​\text{Payload} = \text{A-ID} + "|" + \text{Expiry Timestamp} + "|" + \text{Seconds Variable}
​Example: User12345|1764355200|3600

Sign the Payload: The script uses the Private Key to sign the Payload. This produces the Signature.

Create Final Key: The script concatenates the parts and uses a custom encoding (e.g., Base64) to create a single string for the user.

\text{Final Key} = \text{CustomBase64}(\text{Payload} \ || \ \text{Signature})

2. Key Validation (The Remote Lua Script) 📜
​This is the code that runs remotely. It uses the Public Key to verify the key's authenticity.
​A. Obfuscating the Public Key
​The Public Key must be hidden, as an attacker's first goal is to extract it.

Lua Variable Value Purpose
KeyPart1 "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY..." (The start of the Public Key string) Stored as a large, encrypted string in a random table.
KeyPart2 "..." (The middle part, split by a random, custom character) Stored in an unrelated function's local scope.
FinalPart "...END PUBLIC KEY-----" Generated by a mathematical formula (e.g., character codes XOR'd with a number).
LocalPublicKey The result of reconstructing KeyPart1, KeyPart2, and FinalPart. Only exists in memory briefly for verification.

B. The Verification Logic (Example Flow)
​Decode and Split:
​The script decodes the user's \text{Final Key}.
​It splits it back into the \text{Payload} and the \text{Received Signature}.
​A-ID Check (Anti-Sharing):
​It extracts the \text{A-ID} from the \text{Payload}.
​It checks if the extracted \text{A-ID} matches the current user's ID in the execution environment.
​If the A-IDs don't match, the script stops here: Sharing Failed.
​Cryptographic Verification:
​The script uses the reconstructed LocalPublicKey to verify that the Received Signature was created by the corresponding Private Key over the exact Payload data.
​If the verification fails, the script stops here: Spoofing Failed.
​Data Validation (Anti-Expiration Tamper):
​Only after the signature is verified, the script checks the non-tampered \text{T-EXPIRE} against the current time.
​If the key is expired, the script stops here: Time Limit Failed.
​3. The Security Barrier Against Spooofing
​The entire system relies on the fact that an attacker cannot solve the "Signature Puzzle":
​The Attacker's Goal: Create a key that says, "A-ID is my A-ID, and the Expiry is 20 years from now."
​The Attacker's Problem: They can change the Payload Data, but this instantly invalidates the original \text{Signature}. To create a new, valid Signature for their new Payload Data, they need the Private Key.
​The Outcome: Since the Private Key is secure, their spoofed key will always fail the cryptographic verification step (Step 3) in the Lua script. The key is un-spoofable by anyone except you.
