Prompt 1
Got it â€” Iâ€™ve reviewed the GUI code from your repo, and I understand its structure and behavior. Itâ€™s a modular, executor-safe GUI built using Robloxâ€™s Instance.new system, with:

- A draggable frame
- A textbox for key input
- A validate button
- A status label
- Clean layout and styling

You want the AI to use this exact GUI as the interface for the key validator. Hereâ€™s your updated AI prompt with that requirement added:

---

ðŸ§  Final AI prompt (with GUI integration)

> Build me a full Lua key validation system for Roblox using these constraints:
>
> - The key format is:  
>   <header>|<validfor>|<expiresat>|<payload>|<nonce>|<sha256(validfor|expiresat|payload|nonce|salt)>
> - The key is XOR-obfuscated using a static salt string.
> - The salt is not included in the key â€” only the Lua validator and Python generator know it.
> - I will generate keys using a Python script that follows this format and logic.
>
> Validation steps:
> 1. XOR-decrypt the key using the same salt
> 2. Split by |
> 3. Check header matches the configured value (e.g. "GGL-sandbox")
> 4. Parse validfor and expiresat as UNIX timestamps
> 5. Reject if current time is not within the valid window:  
>    os.time() >= expiresat - validfor and os.time() <= expires_at
> 6. Recompute SHA-256 using validfor|expiresat|payload|nonce|salt and compare to digest
> 7. Block replay using a file-backed cache (used_keys.txt) and fallback to in-memory cache if file APIs are missing
> 8. If valid, inject runtime variables into getgenv() using configurable names:
>    - getgenv()[CONFIG.varexpiry] = expiresat
>    - getgenv()[CONFIG.var_payload] = payload
>    - getgenv()[CONFIG.var_expired] = false
> 9. Start a countdown loop that sets getgenv()[CONFIG.var_expired] = true when expiry is reached
> 10. If config flag CONFIG.executepayload = true, run loadstring(getgenv()[CONFIG.varpayload])() inside a protected call
>
> Payload behavior:
> - The payload should monitor getgenv()[CONFIG.var_expired]
> - When it becomes true, the payload should break itself apart, clean up, or terminate
> - Optionally expose getgenv()CONFIG.varisexpired helper for checking expiry
>
> Configuration block:
> - All values used in validation and encryption should be configurable via a CONFIG table:
>   `lua
>   local CONFIG = {
>       salt = "secret_salt",
>       xor_shift = 7,
>       header = "GGL-sandbox",
>       execute_payload = true,
>       signal_expiry = true,
>       -- dynamic getgenv variable names
>       varexpiry = "myexpiry",
>       varpayload = "mypayload",
>       varexpired = "myexpired",
>       varisexpired = "is_expired"
>   }
>   `
> - The validator must use these values dynamically, not hardcoded.
>
> GUI requirement:
> - You must use this GUI as the interface:  
>   https://github.com/g00glesucksdude-oss/Complicated-key-system/blob/main/gui
> - Do not modify the layout or structure unless necessary for integration
> - Wire the textbox, button, and label into the validator logic
> - Display validation status and countdown to expiry in the GUI
>
> Use this SHA-256 library instead of external ones:  
> https://github.com/g00glesucksdude-oss/Key-system-base/blob/main/sha256
>
> Tools available:
> - isfile, readfile, appendfile for replay protection
> - game:HttpGet for optional remote fetch
> - loadstring for execution
>
> Additional constraints:
> - No need to minify or compress the code
> - Prioritize clarity, modularity, and full functionality
> - Include comments for each function
> - Make the code executor-safe and resilient against sandbox limitations
> - Ensure full compatibility with my Python generator
> - Payload should only execute if validation passes and time window is active
> - Payload must detect expiry and shut itself down when getgenv()[CONFIG.var_expired] == true

Prompt 2

Hereâ€™s how to update your AI prompt to explicitly require generation of the Python key generator alongside the Lua validator:

---

ðŸ”§ Add this to the end of your AI prompt:

> You must also generate the matching Python key generator script.
>
> - It must produce keys in the format:  
>   <header>|<validfor>|<expiresat>|<payload>|<nonce>|<sha256(validfor|expiresat|payload|nonce|salt)>
> - The key must be XOR-obfuscated using the same salt and xor_shift from the config.
> - The salt must not be embedded in the key.
> - All values (header, salt, shift, payload, valid_for, nonce length) must be configurable via a Python CONFIG dictionary.
> - The generator must output a single obfuscated key string.
> - It must be fully compatible with the Lua validator you generate.
> - Do not use external libraries beyond Pythonâ€™s built-in hashlib, time, and random.

---

This addition makes it crystal clear: the AI must generate both the Lua validator and the Python generator, and they must work together seamlessly.

Want me to combine this into your full prompt so you can copy-paste it all at once?

Prompt 3
Got it â€” you're asking the AI to generate a Python script that edits the actual key generator and verifier scripts directly, by rewriting their CONFIG blocks based on your input. It doesnâ€™t just load and run them â€” it modifies the source code itself, regenerating the scripts with your new settings.

Hereâ€™s how youâ€™d phrase that request to the AI:

---

ðŸ§  AI prompt: Python script that rewrites config blocks in source files

> Generate a Python script that edits the actual source code of my key generator and key verifier scripts.
>
> - The script must:
>   - Ask me interactively which config values I want to change
>   - Support editing any of the following fields in the CONFIG dictionary:
>     - salt (string)
>     - xor_shift (integer)
>     - header (string)
>     - valid_for (integer, seconds)
>     - payload (string to be executed via loadstring)
>     - nonce_length (integer)
>     - execute_payload (boolean)
>     - signal_expiry (boolean)
>     - varexpiry, varpayload, varexpired, varis_expired (string names for getgenv() variables)
>   - Open the key generator and verifier .py or .lua files
>   - Locate the CONFIG = { ... } block in each file
>   - Replace the values with my new inputs
>   - Save the updated scripts as new files (e.g. keygenupdated.py, verifierupdated.lua)
> - The script must validate input types (e.g. integers, booleans, strings)
> - It must use only built-in Python libraries (no external dependencies)
> - It must preserve formatting and comments in the original scripts as much as possible

---

This prompt tells the AI to build a source code rewriter that edits your actual scripts â€” not just runs them, but regenerates them with your new config baked in.

Want me to generate that Python config rewriter for you now?
